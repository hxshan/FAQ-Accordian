## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
-JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned how to position multiple images on top of each other with the use of ```css {position:absolute;}```

### Continued development

Im still not fully comfortable with using images so i will focus more on that aspect and improving my JavaScript
